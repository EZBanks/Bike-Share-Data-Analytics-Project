## The company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since
then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The
bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.

## Stakeholders

Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and is responsible for the
development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share
program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.
Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are
responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps
guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. Cyclistic executive team: The
notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to
approve the recommended marketing program.

## Executive Summary

The aim of this analysis is to focus on Cyclistic historical bike trip
data to identify trends. More specifically, the analysis should help
answer the following question: How do annual members and casual riders
use Cyclistic bikes differently? The insights discovered will then help
design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members as the company's finance analysts have concluded that annual
members are much more profitable than casual riders. This report covers
different phases in my analysis to help answer the business questions
raised by the management. These phases include Ask questions, Prepare
data, Process data, Analyze data, Share data, and Act.

## Methodology

Before performing the analysis, the data was collected through a public
domain (<http://www.divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>), then
wrangled to make sure it's cleaned, reliable and error-free by finding
and filling missing values and normalizing data. After that, I explored
and gained insights through variables, proceeded to data visualization
to better capture trends and insights and finally made highly
recommendations to the executive team.

## Ask phase

The executive team asked to analyze Cyclistic historical bike trip data
as they could help design a new marketing strategy to convert more
annual members for the company. More specifically, the following
business question has been raised: How do annual members and casual
riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Prepare phase

The data to explore and analyze was made available by Motivate
International Inc. through:
<http://www.divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>. I proceeded to
the collection and storage of data by making sure they meet the
requirements in terms of integrity, reliability, credibility and
security. I focused my analysis on the following twelve (12) data sets:
202004-divvy-tripdata.csv 202005-divvy-tripdata.csv
202006-divvy-tripdata.csv 202007-divvy-tripdata.csv
202008-divvy-tripdata.csv 202009-divvy-tripdata.csv
202010-divvy-tripdata.csv 202011-divvy-tripdata.csv
202012-divvy-tripdata.csv 202101-divvy-tripdata.csv
202102-divvy-tripdata.csv 202103-divvy-tripdata.csv

Let's import the data sets

```{r}
April_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202004-divvy-tripdata.csv")
May_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202005-divvy-tripdata.csv")
June_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202006-divvy-tripdata.csv")
July_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202007-divvy-tripdata.csv")
August_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202008-divvy-tripdata.csv")
September_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202009-divvy-tripdata.csv")
October_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202010-divvy-tripdata.csv")
November_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202011-divvy-tripdata.csv")
December_2020_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202012-divvy-tripdata.csv")
January_2021_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202101-divvy-tripdata.csv")
February_2021_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202102-divvy-tripdata.csv")
March_2021_Trip <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\BANKS\\Documents\\Mes cours\\Bike-share Data\\202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

## Process phase

Before analyzing data, let's load a number of packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)
library(skimr)
library(tibble)
library(yaml)
library(gapminder)
library(ggpubr)
library(zoo)
library(data.table)

```

Now let’s find and remove any duplicates in the data sets.

```{r identifying duplicates in the data sets}
sum(duplicated(April_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(May_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(June_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(July_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(September_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(October_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(November_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(December_2020_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(January_2021_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(February_2021_Trip))
```
```{r}
sum(duplicated(March_2021_Trip))
```

No duplicates found

Here, I searched and found missing values in my data sets.

```{r identifying missing values in the data sets using colSums(is.na()) function}
colSums(is.na(April_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(May_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(June_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(July_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(August_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(September_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(October_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(November_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(December_2020_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(January_2021_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(February_2021_Trip))
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(March_2021_Trip))
```

All of the data sets contain missing values in columns end_lat and
end_lng while columns start_station_id and end_station_id have some
missing values but in certain data sets. To handle those missing values,
I will use the method of replacing with column mean.

```{r replacing missing values, include=FALSE}
April_2020_Trip <- April_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(April_2020_Trip)) {April_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(April_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(April_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

May_2020_Trip <- May_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(May_2020_Trip)) {May_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(May_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(May_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

June_2020_Trip <- June_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(June_2020_Trip)) {June_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(June_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(June_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

July_2020_Trip <- July_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(July_2020_Trip)) {July_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(July_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(July_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

August_2020_Trip <- August_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(August_2020_Trip)) {August_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(August_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(August_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

September_2020_Trip <- September_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(September_2020_Trip)) {September_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(September_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(September_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

October_2020_Trip <- October_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(October_2020_Trip)) {October_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(October_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(October_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

November_2020_Trip <- November_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(November_2020_Trip)) {November_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(November_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(November_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

December_2020_Trip <- December_2020_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(December_2020_Trip)) {December_2020_Trip[ ,i][is.na(December_2020_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(December_2020_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

January_2021_Trip <- January_2021_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(January_2021_Trip)) {January_2021_Trip[ ,i][is.na(January_2021_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(January_2021_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

February_2021_Trip <- February_2021_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(February_2021_Trip)) {February_2021_Trip[ ,i][is.na(February_2021_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(February_2021_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

March_2021_Trip <- March_2021_Trip
for(i in 1:ncol(March_2021_Trip)) {March_2021_Trip[ ,i][is.na(March_2021_Trip[ ,i])] <- mean(March_2021_Trip[ ,i], na.rm = TRUE)}

```

In this section, I will create a column called "ride_length" and
calculate the length of each ride in seconds for the two user types:
casual riders and annual members.

```{r adding ride_length column}
April_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(April_2020_Trip$ended_at,April_2020_Trip$started_at)

May_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(May_2020_Trip$ended_at,May_2020_Trip$started_at)

June_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(June_2020_Trip$ended_at,June_2020_Trip$started_at)

July_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(July_2020_Trip$ended_at,July_2020_Trip$started_at)

August_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(August_2020_Trip$ended_at,August_2020_Trip$started_at)

September_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(September_2020_Trip$ended_at,September_2020_Trip$started_at)

October_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(October_2020_Trip$ended_at,October_2020_Trip$started_at)

November_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(November_2020_Trip$ended_at,November_2020_Trip$started_at)

December_2020_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(December_2020_Trip$ended_at,December_2020_Trip$started_at)

January_2021_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(January_2021_Trip$ended_at,January_2021_Trip$started_at)

February_2021_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(February_2021_Trip$ended_at,February_2021_Trip$started_at)

March_2021_Trip$ride_length <- difftime(March_2021_Trip$ended_at,March_2021_Trip$started_at)

```

Here I will create a column called "day_of_week" that will help us
understand how casual riders and annual members use the company's bikes
each day of the week.

```{r}
April_2020_Trip <- April_2020_Trip
April_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(April_2020_Trip$started_at))

May_2020_Trip <- May_2020_Trip
May_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(May_2020_Trip$started_at))

June_2020_Trip <- June_2020_Trip
June_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(June_2020_Trip$started_at))

July_2020_Trip <- July_2020_Trip
July_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(July_2020_Trip$started_at))

August_2020_Trip <- August_2020_Trip
August_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(August_2020_Trip$started_at))

September_2020_Trip <- September_2020_Trip
September_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(September_2020_Trip$started_at))

October_2020_Trip <- October_2020_Trip
October_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(October_2020_Trip$started_at))

November_2020_Trip <- November_2020_Trip
November_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(November_2020_Trip$started_at))

December_2020_Trip <- December_2020_Trip
December_2020_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(December_2020_Trip$started_at))

January_2021_Trip <- January_2021_Trip
January_2021_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(January_2021_Trip$started_at))

February_2021_Trip <- February_2021_Trip
February_2021_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(February_2021_Trip$started_at))

March_2021_Trip <- March_2021_Trip
March_2021_Trip$day_of_week<- weekdays(as.Date(March_2021_Trip$started_at))

```

Here I found negative ride lengths which are inconsistent for my
analysis. Then, I will remove them to avoid any problems with my
calculations.

```{r Removing ride_lengths with negative values and creating a new version "V2" of the data sets}

April_2020_Trip_V2 <- April_2020_Trip[!(April_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

May_2020_Trip_V2 <- May_2020_Trip[!(May_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

June_2020_Trip_V2 <- June_2020_Trip[!(June_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

July_2020_Trip_V2 <- July_2020_Trip[!(July_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

August_2020_Trip_V2 <- August_2020_Trip[!(August_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

September_2020_Trip_V2 <- September_2020_Trip[!(September_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

October_2020_Trip_V2 <- October_2020_Trip[!(October_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

November_2020_Trip_V2 <- November_2020_Trip[!(November_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

December_2020_Trip_V2 <- December_2020_Trip[!(December_2020_Trip$ride_length<0),]

January_2021_Trip_V2 <- January_2021_Trip[!(January_2021_Trip$ride_length<0),]

February_2021_Trip_V2 <- February_2021_Trip[!(February_2021_Trip$ride_length<0),]

March_2021_Trip_V2 <- March_2021_Trip[!(March_2021_Trip$ride_length<0),]

```

Now to make sure that merging the twelve data sets into one-year file
will run smoothly, I will convert column "ride_length" from factor to
numeric.

```{r Converting "ride_length" from factor to numeric to help merge the data sets}

Now let's convert the columns "start_station_name", "end_station_name",
"start_station_id", "end_station_id" to character so that they can merge
correctly

```{r}

```

Data has been wrangled and manipulated to ensure they are cleaned and
ready for analysis. Now it is time to merge them into one-year data
frame.

```{r merging the 12 data frames into one-year data frame}

```

```{r Inspecting the new data frame that has been created}

Recalling that the aim of our analysis is to understand how annual
members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. That is why
my analysis will specifically focus on the following variables:
ride_length, day_of_week, member_casual, and rideable_type.

```{r conducting descriptive analysis on "ride_length", “day_of_week”, “member_casual”, and “rideable_type” variables }
summary(one_year_trips$ride_length)
table(one_year_trips$day_of_week)
table(one_year_trips$rideable_type)
table(one_year_trips$member_casual)

```

From the previous output, we notice that:

  *	Riders (casuals and members) spend on average 1677 seconds riding between two (2) stations.
  
  *	Docked bike is the most popular bike type for a total of 2,548,128 trips, followed by electric bike (611,197 trips) and classic bike (319,871 trips) 
  
  *	Weekends have the most important traffic with Saturday (658,179 trips) and Sunday (527,570 trips)
  
  *	Annual members have the most important trips (2,052,075) compared to casual riders (1,427,121 trips)


In this section, I conduct thorough analysis to compare annual members
and casual riders.

```{r calculating the number of rides by weekdays and average duration for each user type}
number_of_rides_and_average_duration_per_usertype <- one_year_trips %>%
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n() ,average_duration =  mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, day_of_week)

```

This allows us to gain insights on how Cyclistic's clients (members and
casuals) use the company's bikes differently in terms of weekdays,
number of rides and average ride length. For example, casual riders are
mostly active on Saturday, and Sunday for respectively 335,059 and
262,271 rides and spend on average 2817.35 and 3044.58 seconds between
two (2) stations.

When it comes to annual members, they are mostly active on Friday
(306,398 trips), and Saturday (323,120 trips), and spend respectively
920.22 and 1067.61 seconds between two (2) stations.

```{r calculating the number of rides for each user type using three types of bike}
number_of_rides_and_biketype_per_usertype <- one_year_trips %>%
  group_by(member_casual, rideable_type) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n() ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>%
  arrange(member_casual, rideable_type)

```

Here I found that casual riders and annual members have the same
preference (counting the number of rides for each bike type) in terms of
bike type used for their trips. Indeed, docked bike is most popular,
followed by electric bike, and classic bike.

## Visualization Phase

Here I will go through a series of visualizations which come from
previous data sets created in the analysis. For each visualization, I
will go deeper in my analysis and explain the trends found.

For this first graph, I plot average ride length against weekdays for
each rider type.

```{r showing Average Duration by weekdays per User Type }
ggplot(data = number_of_rides_and_average_duration_per_usertype, 
       aes(x = day_of_week, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
geom_col(position = "dodge") +
scale_color_manual(values = colors)+
labs(title = "Average Duration by weekdays per User Type", x = "Weekday", y = "Average Duration")

```

We notice that in terms of ride duration, casual riders and annual
members are mostly active at weekends. However, casual riders have on
average the highest ride lengths compared to annual members.
Specifically, casual riders spend on average 3044 seconds on Sunday
(against 1093 seconds for annual members) and 2817 seconds on Saturday
(against 1067 seconds for annual members).

Here I plot number of rides against weekdays for each rider type

```{r showing number of rides by weekdays per User Type }
ggplot(data = number_of_rides_and_average_duration_per_usertype, 
       aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
geom_col(position = "dodge") +
scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue"))+
labs(title = "Number of rides by weekdays per User Type", x = "Weekday", y = "Number of rides")

```

Compared to the previous section, here, annual members have the highest
number of rides compared to casual riders. Specifically, they are mostly
active on Saturday (323,120 trips) and Friday (306,398 trips), When it
comes to casual riders they are mostly active on Saturday (335,059
trips), and Sunday (262,271 trips).

Here, I plot Average Duration against bike type for each rider type.

```{r showing Average Duration by Bike Type per User Type }
ggplot(data = number_of_rides_and_biketype_per_usertype, 
       aes(x = rideable_type, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "plum1"))+
  labs(title = "Average Duration by Bike Type per User Type", x = "Bike Type", 
       y = "Average Duration")

```

We notice that although having the same preference for docked bikes,
casual riders and annual members differ in terms of average ride length
using that bike type. Indeed, casual riders have the highest duration
(3061 seconds) compared to annual members (1027 seconds).

Here, I plot number of rides against bike type for each rider type.

```{r showing Number of rides by Bike Type per User Type }
ggplot(data = number_of_rides_and_biketype_per_usertype, 
       aes(x = rideable_type, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("dodgerblue3", "mediumaquamarine"))+
  labs(title = "Number of rides by Bike Type per User Type", x = "Bike Type", y = "Number of rides")

```

By contrast, here we can see that annual members have the highest number
of rides (1,434,720) using docked bikes compared to casual riders
(1,113,408).

### Analysis Summary

-   In general, annual members have the highest number of rides
    (2,052,075) compared to casual riders (1,427,121) while casual
    riders have the highest average ride length (18552.74 seconds)
    compared to annual members (6768.31 seconds).

-   Annual members and casual riders are mostly active at weekends and
    differ in terms of number of trips on Saturday: casual riders
    (335,059 trips) and annual members (323,120 trips); average ride
    length on Sunday: casual riders (3044 seconds) and annual members
    (1093 seconds).

-   Docked bike is most popular and used by annual members and casual
    riders. However, they differ in terms of highest ride length (3061
    seconds for casual riders against 1027 seconds for annual members)
    and number of rides (1,113,408 rides for casual riders and 1,434,720
    rides for annual members and ).

## Act phase

### High-level recommendations to the executive team

Based on previous analysis, the executive team should apply the
following recommendations to design a new marketing strategy to convert
casual riders into annual members:

-   As casual riders have the highest ride lengths but least number of
    rides, this shows that they are interested in using the bikes for
    long time. Then, the marketing team should propose them a marketing
    offer which will include an attractive annual membership at
    affordable price compared to their single-ride passes and full-day
    passes.

-   Design a special annual marketing offer which is affordable in terms
    of transport costs for casual riders that use the bikes to commute
    to work each day.

-   As casual riders have a particular interest for docked bikes, then
    design a special package exclusively for docked bikes to convert
    them into annual members with a bonus of bringing a family member
    who will benefit of a three-month subscription for free.
